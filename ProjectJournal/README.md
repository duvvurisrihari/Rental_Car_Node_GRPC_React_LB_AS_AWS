# **XP CORE Values**

- The value the team stood by was **Communication**.
- We made sure we set up meeting every week to make sure we knew what each of the team members was doing.
- These team meetings helped us stay up to date with eh issues we were facing and offer help when needed.
- Apart from the weekly Scrum meetings, we also made sure we could connect in between scrum meetings, if necessary, in case someone needs help so one doesn&#39;t need to wait until the next scrum meeting if they&#39;re stuck somewhere.
- A representation of the teams&#39; efforts in making sure we communicated efficiently and frequently is the screenshots of the meeting we had:
